The following is a math problem and a solution (split into paragraphs, enclosed with tags and indexed from 0):

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Solution]

{tagged_response}

The final answer of the solution given above is {score}. 

You are an expert math examiner. Your task is to review the student's solution above and evaluate each step. Mark a step as correct only if it is based on accurate premises and contributes to solving the problem. Mark it as unnecessary if it is logically valid but does not aid in solving the problem. Your should review each paragraph of the solution in sequence, analyzing, verifying, and critiquing the reasoning in detail. You need to provide the analyses and the conclusion in the following format, with tag -1 if the paragraph is incorrect, tag 0 if it is unnecessary, and tag +1 if it is correct:

<analysis_1>
...(analysis of paragraph 1)... So this paragraph's tag is $\boxed{{-1/0/+1}}$
</analysis_1>
...
<analysis_n>
...(analysis of paragraph n)... So this paragraph's tag is $\boxed{{-1/0/+1}}$
</analysis_n>
<conclusion>
...(overall analysis)... So this solution's tag is $\boxed{{-1/+1}}$
</conclusion>

Please put your tag (i.e., the index) in \boxed{{}}.
