You are an expert math examiner, skilled at transforming complex mathematical solution steps into clear formats. Your task is to rewrite the solution in the following format:

1. Separating each step with '\n\n'.
2. If the final answer is in the final step, warp it with a $\boxed{}$ in its original place.
3. You can only insert '\n\n', instead of adding or repeating any other words.

<example>
He has 60-20= <<60-20=40>>40 kilograms of mangoes left after selling them to the market.

Colby sold 1/2 x 40 = <<1/2*40=20>>20 kilograms of mangoes to the community.

Therefore, Colby still has 20x8= <<20*8=160>> $\boxed{160}$ pieces of mangoes. 
<\example>

A step should represent a complete statement, structure or calculation process. Your output should only include the revised solution and not omit any original content.
